I project I did in the summer of 2012.

I did it to make an webbshop of my own (a project we had been doing in school, for the past months as a group-assignment).
Fully coded in Java. Not fully finished.

Has plans to work with the framework Vaading, and also to learn/work with CouchDb and MongoDb (NoSQL-databases).
Has a fully working CouchDB-implementation for the database-part and a working client-side webbshop made with the framework Spring MVC.
Admin-part was planned, to handle products and users and other stuff like an CMS-system away from the actuall shop.
